# Behaviour Lab Backend Technical Interview

Congratulations on making it to the Behaviour Lab take-home task! We know these can be long and tedious but this one is different - please spend no longer than 3-4 hours on both tasks combined and try to have fun.

Please fork this repository, and complete each task in it's own subfolder.

Once you've finished, submit the project to `jobs@behaviourlab.com`, `yannis@behaviourlab.com`, `louis@behaviourlab.com` and `steven.painter@behaviourlab.com`:

- Please make this repo private and invite _yp717_, _shanwun_, and _smpeepers_ to the repository.

## What are we testing

Let’s cut to the chase - candidates hate it when the tests are confusing and its not clear what they’re for. We like to be transparent, so for full disclosure, this test aims to evaluate a candidates ability:

- to solve and break down problems
- to write great Python code
- to build custom API endpoints
- to work with the Django REST API
- to create a relational DB
- to read information from a relational DB
- to trigger communication with a third party API
